### Preliminary
* Due high fragmentation of Android devices configurations, there always remains a chance for occasional bootloop, after flashing Magisk modules incompatible with your device.
* Therefore, to minimise such risk, while installing any Magisk modules, use custom recovery, which has an option to disable them in case of bootloop, such as the latest version of Orangefox recovery.
* If you don't have it, make full system and data backup or at least vendor backup. 

### Installation Guide
* Install the module via Magisk Manager and reboot system.

### Troubleshooting
* If bootloop happens, reboot into recovery and disable module. Use recovery with inbuilt manager of Magisk modules, such as last version of Orangefox. If you don't have, download it on pc, copy to sd card and then reboot into your recovery and flash it.
